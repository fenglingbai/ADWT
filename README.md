# Ultrastructural Analysis of Synapses Reveals Dendritic Dysfunction in the Prefrontal Cortex of Alzheimer's Rat Model


## Introduction

This study demonstrates the utility of volume electron microscopy in quantitatively analyzing dendritic and synaptic structural changes in AD rat models. Our findings reveal significant alterations in mitochondrial size and density, alongside degeneration of dendritic spines, suggesting compromised synaptic function. The methodologies developed here provide a framework for future research into 3D reconstruction of synaptic structures, advancing our understanding of AD pathology and potentially guiding therapeutic strategies to address synaptic dysfunction.
